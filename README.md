# Nickapril.me - a Personal Tech Blog

Created by Nick April


### Overview

Nickapril.me is a personal blog built on Jekyll for current and past technical projects. It was created partly as a space to publicly post my projects but also for just for some fun HTML and CSS practice. I also wanted to make it more professional by hiding the github pages URL so it is hosted on a personal domain and set up with SSL connection.
