description: This Ruby on Rails Web application was built last spring to help improve student learning in large university classes. TA OnDemand standardizes teaching assistant office hour scheduling and provides a space for virtually hosted office hours. This application will encourage interaction among teaching assistants and students and therefore improve the quality of student learning.

TA OnDemand consists of three main features:
1. Dynamic scheduler 
2. Appointments
3. Live chat

My main contribution to this team project was the Live Chat feature built with Web Sockets.
