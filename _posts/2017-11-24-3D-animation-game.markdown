description: This 3D animated game was built in Blender with a team of 5 undergraduates at Brandeis University. The game consists of 3 levels in which the user must complete challenges and avoid attacks from enemies.

My contribution to this project was the design and logic of the first level. When the user starts the game, they are placed just outside a building modeled after Spingold Theater on the Brandeis Campus. The landscape was built in a textures skybox and consists of many textures objects. Zombies are spread out over the landscape and are programmed to chase the avatar if it comes within a certain distance. The user must use the arrow keys to get into the building while avoiding any zombies.
