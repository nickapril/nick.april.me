description: This 3D animated game was built in Blender with a team of 5 undergraduates at Brandeis University. The game consists of 3 levels in which the user must complete challenges and avoid attacks from zombies.

My main contribution to this project was the design and logic of the first level. When the user starts the game, they are placed just outside a building modeled after the Spingold Theater building on the Brandeis Campus. The user must find their way inside quickly though, zombies begin to chase them.
